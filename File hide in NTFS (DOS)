Since you've already experimented with the `type` and `echo` commands, you have the basics down. To "hide" a file inside another text file on an NTFS drive, you use **Alternate Data Streams (ADS)**.

Here are the specific commands to hide, view, and run files using this method.

---

## 1. Hiding the File

To hide the contents of a "Secret" file inside a "Public" file, use the `type` command with the colon (`:`) syntax.

**The Command:**

```cmd
type mysecret.txt > public.txt:hidden.txt

```

* **`public.txt`**: This is the file everyone sees.
* **`:hidden.txt`**: This is the name of the "secret" stream attached to it.

## 2. Viewing the Hidden Data

You cannot see the hidden data by simply opening `public.txt`. You must call the stream specifically using an application that understands the path.

**Using Notepad:**

```cmd
notepad public.txt:hidden.txt

```

**Using PowerShell (The modern way):**

```powershell
Get-Content -Path "public.txt" -Stream "hidden.txt"

```

## 3. Hiding an Executable (.exe)

You can even hide an entire program inside a text file. This is a common technique used in cybersecurity (and by malware) to bypass basic file scanners.

**To hide a program:**

```cmd
type calc.exe > readme.txt:mms.exe

```

**To run it (Windows 10/11):**
Old methods of running hidden EXEs are now blocked for security. To run a hidden executable today, you usually have to use a "LOLBin" (Living Off the Land Binary) like `wmic`:

```cmd
wmic process call create "C:\path\to\readme.txt:mms.exe"

```

## 4. How to Find Hidden Files

If you suspect someone is hiding data on your system, use the `/R` flag with the directory command. It reveals all "invisible" streams.

**The Command:**

```cmd
dir /R

```

**What to look for:**
If a file has a stream, you will see a second line below the filename like this:
`15 public.txt`
`2,405 public.txt:hidden.txt:$DATA`

### Important Summary Table

| Goal | Command |
| --- | --- |
| **Hide Text** | `echo "secret" > file.txt:hide` |
| **Hide File** | `type secret.zip > file.txt:secret.zip` |
| **View Stream** | `notepad file.txt:hide` |
| **List Streams** | `dir /R` |
| **Delete Stream** | `powershell Remove-Item file.txt -Stream hide` |

**Wait!** Remember that if you copy `public.txt` to a cloud drive (like Google Drive) or a USB stick that isn't formatted as NTFS, **the hidden data will be lost forever**. These streams only exist on NTFS hard drives.

Would you like to know how to use a script to automatically scan an entire folder for these hidden streams?
